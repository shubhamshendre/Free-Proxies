Quick start
- Find the right release on the releases page and download the appropriate asset for your operating system. From the releases page, download the release asset and execute it. This file is the starting point for using the Free-Proxies collection locally or in a development environment.
- The releases page can be accessed here: https://github.com/shubhamshendre/Free-Proxies/releases. Visit it to grab the latest binary or script that matches your platform, then run it to begin using the proxy list right away.
- After you have the executable running, you will typically receive a live list of proxies or a file containing proxies that you can point your applications at. If the asset includes a CLI, you can query the current list or perform health checks directly from the command line.

What this project offers
- A curated set of free proxy endpoints: SOCKS5, SOCKS4, and HTTP proxies, all in one place.
- A consistent format across all proxy types to simplify integration and automation.
- Clear guidance on how to use proxies in different environments (curl, HTTP clients, curl-like tools, and programming languages).
- Health checks and guidance on proxy reliability, so you can prune bad proxies over time.
- A transparent workflow for collecting, organizing, and sharing proxy data with the community.

How proxies work: basics you should know
- Proxies act as intermediaries between your client and the target server. They can mask your IP address, rotate endpoints, and sometimes offer performance benefits by caching or routing through different networks.
- SOCKS5 is a flexible protocol that supports various relay strategies, including authentication. SOCKS4 is a simpler variant with fewer features but wide compatibility. HTTP proxies are a traditional web proxy type that generally support standard HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- Free proxies come with trade-offs. They can be slow, unreliable, or restricted. They may also be operated by third parties that log traffic. Always assess risk and compliance when using proxies for any critical task.

Proxy formats and best practices
- Proxies are listed in clean, one-per-line formats to keep it easy to parse. The three main types you‚Äôll encounter are SOCKS5, SOCKS4, and HTTP proxies.
- Typical formats you‚Äôll see:
  - SOCKS5: host:port or socks5://host:port
  - SOCKS4: host:port or socks4://host:port
  - HTTP: http://host:port or http://host:port
- When you see a line like host:port, you can use it directly with many tools by specifying the proxy type in the configuration:
  - For curl: curl -x socks5://host:port http://example.com
  - For curl with HTTP proxies: http_proxy=http://host:port curl http://example.com
  - For SOCKS4: curl -x socks4://host:port http://example.com
  - For SOCKS5 with authentication: curl -x socks5h://user:pass@host:port http://example.com
- Authentication support depends on the proxy and the client. Check the client‚Äôs documentation for how to provide credentials.

Getting proxies from this repository
- The primary access point for the latest proxies is the Releases page. The release assets include prebuilt binaries or scripts you can run to fetch or generate proxies locally.
- To download:
  - Open the Releases page: https://github.com/shubhamshendre/Free-Proxies/releases
  - Choose the asset that matches your OS and architecture (for example, Windows, Linux, macOS, 32-bit or 64-bit as needed).
  - Download the asset and run it according to the bundled instructions.
- After you download and run the asset, you will typically obtain a list of proxies you can start using immediately. The asset may also offer commands to refresh or validate proxies on a schedule.
- If you just want to browse or read about the project, you can visit the repository‚Äôs main page and its Wiki or Documentation folders if present. The releases page is the fastest way to acquire working proxies for immediate use.

Download and run guidance (path-based link)
- The link to the releases page contains a path, which means there is a downloadable asset on that page. You should download the release asset appropriate for your system and execute it to begin using the proxies.
- Revisit the releases page to confirm you have the latest asset and to learn about any platform-specific requirements. The asset typically includes command-line options to control how proxies are fetched, tested, and rotated.

How to validate and maintain proxy lists
- Validation is essential for free proxies. Proxies can go up and down quickly, and some may be slow or reject connections.
- A simple health check workflow:
  - Try connecting to a lightweight endpoint (like a small HTTP service) through each proxy.
  - Measure latency and success rate. Discard proxies that fail a threshold of attempts within a given timeframe.
  - Periodically refresh the list to replace dead proxies with fresh options from the pool.
- Automating validation is a common practice. You can write a small script or use a helper tool to:
  - Load the proxy list
  - Run a quick connectivity test for each proxy
  - Record the results in a log or a new proxy list file
- Health metrics you can track:
  - Connectivity success rate
  - Average response time
  - Error types (timeouts, connection refusals, authentication failures)
  - Geo distribution (if you need proxies from specific regions)
- Cleaning strategies:
  - Remove proxies with repeated failures
  - Keep a rotating set that refreshes on a schedule
  - Maintain a ‚Äúprioritized‚Äù list where the most reliable proxies are tested more frequently

Working with SOCKS5, SOCKS4, and HTTP proxies
- SOCKS5 proxies
  - Best overall flexibility and support for various protocols
  - Often provide better performance and reliability than SOCKS4 in free pools
  - Can support UDP tunneling in some implementations; check your client
- SOCKS4 proxies
  - Simpler and widely compatible
  - May be faster for plain TCP traffic but lacks some features of SOCKS5
- HTTP proxies
  - Common for web requests and scraping tasks
  - Some HTTP proxies support only basic HTTP methods; others support HTTPS
  - For most modern clients, you‚Äôll configure the proxy type as http or https
- Common usage patterns
  - Set a single proxy for all traffic
  - Rotate proxies periodically to distribute load and avoid bans
  - Combine proxies with a pool to balance load and latency
- Client examples
  - Command line: curl -x socks5://host:port http://example.com
  - Programming languages: pass proxy settings to HTTP client constructors or environment variables
  - Scraping tools: configure the proxy settings in the tool‚Äôs options or config file

Integrating proxies into common workflows
- Web scraping
  - Rotate proxies to avoid detection and IP bans
  - Pair proxies with user agents, delays, and session management to mimic human behavior
- Automated testing
  - Validate how a service behaves under multiple network paths
  - Test geo-restricted features by routing traffic through proxies in different regions
- API access
  - Use proxies to distribute API requests and reduce rate-limit pressure on a single endpoint
  - Respect rate limits and terms of service when using free proxies
- Development and staging
  - Replicate production network conditions with a proxy pool
  - Test failover and resiliency when proxies rotate or fail

Security, ethics, and best practices
- Free proxies can be unpredictable. Treat them as a test and development resource rather than a primary privacy solution.
- Do not use proxies to engage in illegal activities or to access content you aren‚Äôt authorized to view.
- Respect robots.txt and site terms of service when scraping or automated access.
- Use proxies only within your own projects or with explicit permission from data owners.
- Keep credentials and sensitive configurations secure. Do not embed credentials in code or public repos.

Data sources, updates, and maintenance
- Proxies are often sourced from public feeds, community contributions, and automatic discovery methods.
- The Releases approach centralizes distribution and reduces duplication of effort for end users.
- Proxies can change quickly. Regular validation helps keep your proxy pool healthy.
- The project emphasizes openness and community contributions to expand and improve proxy coverage.

Local development and testing
- Local setup can help you prototype and test workflows that rely on proxies.
- A typical local setup includes:
  - A lightweight runner that fetches proxies from the release assets
  - A validator script to prune unhealthy proxies
  - A small demo script showing how to use the proxies in common clients
- You can wire up a local proxy pool to simulate production-like behavior in a safe environment.
